# 🌱 What I Learned — Reverse Integer

Solving this problem gave me several important takeaways, both technical and conceptual:

## 📌 1. Importance of Edge Case Thinking
Careful handling of special values like `0`, negative numbers, and numbers that exceed boundaries is crucial in any production-quality code.

## 💡 2. Overflow Awareness
In competitive programming and system-level problems, being aware of memory and size constraints (like 32-bit vs 64-bit integers) makes a big difference. I learned to think like the **system**, not just the programmer.

## 🔢 3. Math over Strings
It’s tempting to convert numbers into strings and reverse them, but doing it mathematically gave me better control over performance and constraints. This approach also improves understanding of digit-level manipulation.

## ⚙️ 4. Writing Reusable Patterns
The modulus-and-division pattern for reversing numbers is something I can now reuse confidently in other problems involving digits (e.g., palindrome numbers, digital root, etc.)

## ✅ 5. Defensive Programming
Explicit checks like `if (res > INT_MAX || res < INT_MIN)` helped me realize how small safeguards prevent large runtime issues.
