# ⚠️ Challenges Faced — Reverse Integer

Working on the Reverse Integer problem on LeetCode presented several challenges:

## 1. 🧮 Handling Integer Overflow
The main difficulty was ensuring that the reversed integer didn't exceed the **32-bit signed integer** range. Since the result can easily go beyond this range during reversal (especially with numbers like 1534236469), I had to use a `long long` type temporarily and check explicitly against `INT_MAX` and `INT_MIN`.

## 2. ⛔ Environment Restriction on 64-bit Storage
The prompt specifically mentioned **not to use 64-bit integers**, which made me cautious about relying on types like `long long`. This restriction required balancing between safe reversal and environment constraints — a good exercise in precision.

## 3. 🔁 Edge Case Handling
Special edge cases tested my implementation:
- **Zero values** like `x = 0`
- **Negative inputs** like `x = -123`
- **Trailing zeroes** (e.g., `120 → 21`)
- **Minimum int value**: reversing `-2147483648` causes overflow.

## 4. 💥 Sign Restoration
While reversing the digits, it’s easy to forget to restore the sign if the number was originally negative. Forgetting this can cause correct logic to fail subtly.

## 5. 🧼 Keeping Code Clean Without String Conversion
Avoiding string conversion for digit reversal helped me stay in low-level logic and forced better numeric thinking. But it added some mental complexity in tracking digit-by-digit manipulation.
